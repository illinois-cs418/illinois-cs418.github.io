1. Read the submission instructions carefully!
If you are missing some files, but we can still grade, you will lose 20%.
If we cannot grade your work due to missing files, you will receive no credit.
2. You code must have comments for each function explaining what that function does, using the [Google JS commenting style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-comments)
