**Submit all the files needed to run your app including gl-matrix-min.js or similar library files**

Submit the files in **zipped** folder to Compass.

Use the following naming conventions for your files:

+ mpN.html

+ mpN.js

+ You can use any naming convention you wish for additional JS you use (e.g. Terrain.js or Sphere.js, etc.)

**Test your app right before you submit and after renaming any files.**<br/>
Not updating the name of a JS file file sourced in mpN.html is a common bug

In the file name, replace N with the number of the MP (e.g. MP1.html).<br/>
You should also include any additional files you use or have written.<br/> 
In particular you can use the glMatrix library gl-matrix-min.js.<br/>

Name your submission as  NETID_MPN.zip and submit it to Compass, where  NETID is your netid and N is the MP number. This MP (as are the other MP's) is more than just an assignment for a grade to verify graphics programming proficiency. It is also an opportunity to impress me, your friends/family and your future employer or graduate school.
