## Overview ##

Interactive Computer Graphics is about the techniques and technologies used to generate synthetic digital imagery in real-time. The main focus of the course will be 3D photorealistic rendering and the current rendering methods used in games and other interactive applications.

The topics we will cover include:
+ Geometric modeling
+ Mathematics for animation and rendering
+ Shading and programmable shaders
+ Rasterization
+ Physics simulation
+ Basic animation

We will learn how to implement 3D web applications using WebGL and JavaScript. WebGL shares many of the same characteristics as Vulkan, Direct3D, and other popular low-level graphics APIs, so the skills you learn should be transferable.

## Communication ##

#### [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/GCA3888BE) ####
We will use Campuswire for answering questions. Use the code 7365 to join as a student.

+ For any question involving a grade you should select `Post to instructors and TAs`.
+ We will attempt to help debug upon request but ultimately debugging is your responsibility.
+ When you ask for help debugging, provide a clear statement of the bug behavior and how you attempted to debug so far.
+ You are allowed to post code snippets when asking for help debugging.

## Instructional Content ##

The course will be taught using live and online lectures along with additional reading materials.

+ Lectures videos and notes will be available **[here](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/schedule).**
+ Additional reading may be assigned from **resources listed [here](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/resources).**

### Lectures ###

**You can attend live lecture/discussion at:<br/>
 11am Central Time on Wednesdays in [Room 103 Transportation Building 104 S. Mathews Ave.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Transportation+Building/@40.1117016,-88.2253098,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x8fc3be7e3545974b!8m2!3d40.1117016!4d-88.2253098)**.
+ We will focus on actively working through problems and doing code walkthroughs... 
+ These lectures will be recorded and available on the [course schedule](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/schedule). 
+ Additional lectures will be available as asynchronous video links posted on the [course schedule](https://illinois-cs418.github.io/schedule).  

**The current plan is not to have a live lecture on Fridays, but instead use it for asynchronous videos and exams**

## Assessments ##

Assigned work will include 10 Quizzes, 5 programming assignments and 3 exams.<br/>
There will be an additional project for students taking the course for 4 credits.

### Quizzes ###
There will be short weekly quizzes on [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl). 
+ **Each quiz can be taken repeatedly..you can retake it till you get all the questions correct**
+ **They will be assigned on a Monday and due at 11:59PM on Monday of the following week.**
+ **After the due date, quizzes can still be completed late for 50% credit at any time before May 9.**
+ These quizzes will be based on the lecture material and will serve as practice for the exams.

### Programming Assignments ###
There will a series of five programming assignments. <br/>
**Please read the [Assignments page](/assignments) for details of how code development will be done.**

### 4 Credit Project ###
If you are taking the course for 4 credits, you will complete an extra project implelementing a ray-tracer.

### Exams ###
This class will have exams and no final exam. Each exam is on [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl).

- Exam 1: 11am-12pm, Feb. 18, 2022 
- Exam 2: 11am-12pm, March 25, 2022
- Exam 3: 11am-12pm, May 4, 2022

The exams will be online using Prairielearn. **They will be synchronous and will last for 1 hour from 11am-12pm Central Time on the day of the exam**
They are open web - you can use any reference material you wish while taking the exam. You should not collaborate with other people. Any instances of collaboration will be considered a violation of academic integrity and will result in a 0 on the exam and a letter grade reduction in the final course grade. Also, the nature of the exam will make collaboration unhelpful - you will get a better grade working on your own rather than wasting time trying to work together.  

## Grades ##
We will post grades on [Canvas](){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

We weight grades as follows:

| | 3 credits | 4 credits |  
| ----- | ------ | ----- |  
| MP 1 | 10% | 10% | 
| MP 2 | 10% | 5% | 
| MP 3 | 5% | 5% | 
| MP 4 | 10% | 5% | 
| MP 5 | 5% | 5% | 
| Quizzes| 15%  | 15%  |
| Exam Grade| 45% | 45% |   
| 4 Credit Project | | 10% |  

The course grade cutoffs can be expected to be:

|Percentage lower bound | Grade |  
| ----- | ------ | 
| 99%| A+ |
| 93% | A |  
| 90% | A- |  
| 87% | B+ |  
| 83% | B |  
| 80% | B- |  
| 77% | C+ |  
| 73% | C |  
| 70% | C- | 
| 67% | D+ |  
| 63% | D |  
| 60% | D- |  
| 0%  | F  |
